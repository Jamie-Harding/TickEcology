## Introduction
These are my steps for initially cleaning the Excel documents so they can be analyzed in R and ArcGIS

### Step 1: Changing sheetnames
Change Site info - tick species to SiteSpecies
Change Ixodes spp. per waypoint to IxodesWaypoint

### Step 2: Change the file names to a variation of CaLSeN _{Year}
Examples:
CaLSeN_ON_2019
CaLSeN_BC_2020
CaLSeN_2021

### Step 3: Ensure number of columns are the same in all files
